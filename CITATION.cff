abstract: pqcrypto is a cross-platform implementation of the Lemniscate-AGM Isogeny (LAI) encryption scheme,
  a post-quantum cryptosystem based on elliptic curve isogenies over lemniscate lattices. This package
  supports multiple languages including Python, JavaScript, Ruby, C#, and Java. It is designed for
  secure communication, research, and educational purposes.
